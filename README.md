# TextClassification

A Feedforward neural network for text classification consisting of:

– One-hot input layer mapping words into an Embedding weight matrix 

– One hidden layer computing the mean embedding vector of all words in input followed by a ReLU activation function

– Output layer with a softmax activation 

- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm with back-propagation to learn the weights of the Neural network
